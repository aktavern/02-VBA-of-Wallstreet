# 02-VBA-of-Wallstreet
VBA script which evaluates, formats, and manipulates stock data.

This script achieves the "Moderate" level and the challenges by addressing the following requirements:

1. Loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

2. Display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

3. Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:

* The ticker symbol.

* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The total stock volume of the stock.

4. Have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

# Assumptions
When the yearly change requires a divide by 0, it assumes the change is 0.
